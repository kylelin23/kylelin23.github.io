                        Last month was full of a lot of ups and downs. College has started really well!
                        Classes are not too bad so far. Theory of Computation has been really interesting
                        and I look forward to taking it more!

                        My first week went well! I'm not used to living off campus, but it's not too bad.
                        The bus comes really often and is pretty consistent. Even if I do miss the bus,
                        I can also always walk to school because the walk to school is only thirty minutes.
