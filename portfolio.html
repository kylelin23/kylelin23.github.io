                            This is a website for teachers to access a database of best teaching practices
                            for infants and toddlers for the Neighborhood House Association.
                            There are many resources to access teaching strategies from, however
                            this website will be a centralized place to access all of them.
                            The website will accomplish this by fetching, filtering (based off of dropdowns)
                            and displaying data from over 2000 rows of google sheet data.</p>

                            The goal of this app is to let new cat adopters have a more smooth adoption.
                            There are countless things to remember and worry about when adopting a cat,
                            such as what to feed them, whether or not to let them outside, and much more.
                            So, this app's goal is to create a user-friendly way for new cat adopters
                            to easily access reliable information on cat adoption.

                            When college students and young adults enter the adult world,
                            they face many challenges, one of which is financial responsibility.
                            Being a student in college or entering life as an adult allows individuals
                            to spend as much as they like on items such as food, fashion, and accessories.
                            This in turn creates bad spending habits leading to irresponsible and
                            unchecked spending. The purpose of this app is to help control this chaotic spending.
