                            This is a website for teachers to access a database of best teaching practices
                            for infants and toddlers for the Neighborhood House Association.
                            There are many resources to access teaching strategies from, however
                            this website will be a centralized place to access all of them.
                            The website will accomplish this by fetching, filtering (based off of dropdowns)
                            and displaying data from over 2000 rows of google sheet data.</p>
